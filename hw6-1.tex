You are trying to sabotage a flow network $G=(V,E)$ on $n$ nodes and $m$ edges by removing at most $k$ edges from $G$ to form a new flow network $G'$. Assume that  every edge in $G$ has unit capacity. Design an algorithm that given as input a flow network $G$ and an integer $k>0$ outputs a list of at most $k$ edges to be removed from $G$ such that  value of the maximum flow of the resulting flow network $G'$ is minimized. Your algorithm should run in time $O(mn)$.
