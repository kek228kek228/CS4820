{\bf (2)} {\em (10 points)}
  Suppose we are given an instance of the stable matching
  problem, consisting of a set of $n$ applicants
  $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ and a set of $n$ employers
  $\{y_1,\ldots,y_n\}$, together with a list for
  each entity (applicant or employer) that ranks the
  entities of the opposite type from best to worst.
  This exercise concerns algorithms to solve the following
  problem: {\em decide whether there exists a stable perfect
  matching in which $x_n$ is matched to $y_n$}.
  \vskip \gap
{\bf (2a)}
  A simple algorithm for this problem is the following:
  remove $x_n$ from every employer's preference list,
  and remove $y_n$ from every applicant's preference list.
  Run the Gale-Shapley algorithm (say, with employers proposing)
  to find a stable
  perfect matching, $M$, of the applicant set
  $\{x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}\}$ and employer set
  $\{y_1,\ldots,y_{n-1}\}$.
  If $M \cup \{(x_n,y_n)\}$ is a stable perfect matching
  of the original $2n$ entities
  (with their original unmodified preference
  lists) then answer ``yes''; otherwise, answer ``no''.
  Give an explicit input instance on which this
  algorithm outputs the wrong answer.
  \vskip \gap
{\bf (2b)}
  Design a polynomial-time algorithm to decide
  whether there exists a stable perfect
  matching in which $x_n$ is matched to $y_n$.
  Prove that your algorithm always outputs
  the correct answer and analyze its running
  time.

  {\bf Hint:} The solved exercises at the end
  of Chapter 1 in the textbook may provide a
  useful subroutine for your algorithm.
