{\bf (1)} {\em (10 points)}



{\bf (1a)} {\em (3 points)} Let $G= (A \cup B, E)$ be an undirected $p$-regular bipartite graph, i.e., every vertex in $A \cup B$ has degree exactly $p$. Prove that $G$ has a perfect matching.

{\bf (1b)} {\em (7 points)} Latin rectangles are well studied objects in combinatorics, and various popular puzzles are  based on Latin rectangles. For integers $m\le n$, any  $m \times n$ matrix, with each entry in the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, such that each integer appears at most once in each row and at most once in each column is called an $(m,n)$-Latin rectangle. An $(n,n)$-Latin rectangle is called an $n$-Latin square. Prove that any $(m,n)$-Latin rectangle can be extended to an $n$-Latin square. Given as input an $(m ,n)$-Latin rectangle, design an efficient algorithm that  extends the Latin rectangle to an $n$-Latin square.
