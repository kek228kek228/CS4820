{\bf (1)} {\em (15 points)} Define $(\le k)$-CNF to be a CNF with each clause containing at most $k$ literals, and a $k$-CNF to be a CNF with each clause containing exactly $k$ literals.

{\bf (1a)} {\em (8 points)} Consider a  variant of 3SAT, which we call $(2,3)$-LSAT, defined in the following way: An input instance of $(2,3)$-LSAT is a $(\le 3)$-CNF on $n$ variables, with the additional restriction that each literal appears at most $2$ times, and the output is `Yes' if the given instance is satisfiable and `No' otherwise. Either (i) design an efficient algorithm that  finds a satisfying assignment to an input instance of $(2,3)$-LSAT or outputs `Impossible' in the case that the input instance is unsatisfiable, or  (ii) prove that it is NP-complete.

{\bf (1b)} {\em (7 points)} Consider another  variant of 3SAT, which we call $(3,3)$-VSAT, defined in the following way: An input instance of $(3,3)$-VSAT is a $3$-CNF on $n$ variables, with the additional restriction that each variable appears at most $3$ times, and the output is  `Yes' if the given instance is satisfiable and 'No' otherwise.   Either (i) design an efficient algorithm that  finds a satisfying assignment to an input instance of $(3,3)$-VSAT or outputs `Impossible' in the case that the input instance is unsatisfiable, or  (ii) prove that it is NP-complete.
